---

## What is this course?

CSCI 4810 focuses on writing the algorithms necessary to build a basic graphics package.
The course entails the following topics: Imaging Science & Applications, Impact of Computer Graphics to
hardware/software/technology, Display devices (Raster-scan, Random-scan, DVST, ...),
input and output devices, line-drawing algorithms (DDA, Bresenham's, ...), antialiasing
lines (may be), circle-generating algorithms (Bresenham's, ellipses, curves, ...), different
styles of lines, color and intensity (color lookup tables, gray scale), area filling algorithms
(Scan-line, Flood-fill, ...), two-dimensional transformations, windowing and clipping
algorithms, window-to-viewport transformation, introduction to image processing and
applications, image data structures (quadtree, octrees, run-length, ...), high-performance
computing for graphics, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), parallel processing, 3D
graphics, 3D geometric transformations, perspective projection, parallel projection and
other visualization techniques, hidden-line/surface removals, advance shading models, etc.

## How are the assignments are completed?

For these assignments, I used the Java 2D package which is a part of the Swing library.
